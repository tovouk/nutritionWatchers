# Nutrition Watchers

## Where have I been lately?
Hi, If you've noticed my recent inacitivity here it's because I started using bitbucket's private
repositories and have been busy with internship prep and school work.


## What is this?
Nutrition Watchers is an extra credit assignment I received for my
database management class. This app is not meant to be the next myfitnesspal,
it is a demonstration of using SQL in android, through Room.

#### Is it done?
At the time of writing, I have yet to complete
it as I have to study for other courses and exams.

In fact one could say this app is in it's mere infancy. I do plan on finishing
the first prototype before the end of the year.

##### Important note
As it is still in development, keep in mind that this app is not built for
use in production as database calls would not be made in the main thread per
Room best practices and it is recommended to use LiveData. This too is in the works,
I am taking it one step at a time and focusing on functionality first.
